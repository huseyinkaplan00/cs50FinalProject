## Description

**Your Dictionary** is a web-based dictionary application, developed as the final project for CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This application serves as a practical demonstration of the programming skills and technologies learned throughout the course.

### Purpose for CS50x

This project encapsulates the essence of CS50x by integrating key programming concepts and technologies such as API integration, React framework, responsive web design, and state management in React. It is designed to address the real-world need for an accessible and comprehensive online dictionary, showcasing the application of course learnings in solving practical problems.

## CS50x: An Overview

CS50x, Harvard University's introduction to computer science and the art of programming, is an entry-level course that enables students to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
